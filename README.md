<b>Task 3: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.</b>
<p>Equipped with a robust background in data preprocessing and analysis, I embarked on the realm of machine learning. Task 3 focused on constructing a predictive model to enhance inventory management. Under the guidance of Prodigy's data science team, I approached algorithms with the precision of a seasoned explorer, delicately adjusting hyperparameters and rigorously validating my model. Observing the close alignment of my model's predictions with real-world outcomes was a rewarding experience, emphasizing the potency of data-driven decision-making. This task underscored that machine learning transcends being a mere tool; it emerges as a strategic asset with the potential to revolutionize industries.</p>
